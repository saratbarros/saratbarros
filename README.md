### Hi there 👋


Nice to meet you! My name is Sara Barros, welcome to my GitHub page. Let me tell you more about me, I'm 29 years old and originally from a small island called Madeira. I'm currently residing in London, United Kingdom. However, in a few years, I'd would like move to another country (still debating and waiting on a possible job offer🤔). <br>
I'm currently freelancing as a eCommerce Digital Project executive for a fashion brand. But I'm also a Junior Front-End Developer and my skills are being applied withing my current role! I fell down the rabbit hole of Front-End specturm in 2020 whilst working with an external team of developers. I have been self-teaching myself and taking online courses from SuperHi! and Treehouse currently undergoing a 3 Front-End development courses via Udemy :smile: <br>
When I'm not learning and developing my Front-End skills, you can find me reading a book or planning my next travel - I love travelling :airplane: Other hobbies include photography, listening to music and learning new languages.
