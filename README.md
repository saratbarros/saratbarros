### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


Nice to meet you! My name is Sara Barros, welcome to my GitHub page. Let me tell you more about me, I'm 29 years old and originally from a small island called Madeira. I'm currently residing in London, United Kingdom. However, in a few years, I'd would like move to another country (or work remotely waiting for the job offer to apperðŸ¤”). <br>
I'm currently freelancing as a eCommerce Digital Project Executive for a fashion brand. But I'm also a self-taught Front-End Developer and my skills are being applied withing my current role! I fell down the rabbit hole of Front-End specturm in 2020 whilst working with an external team of developers. I have been learning by taking online courses from SuperHi,Treehouse and ZTM academy currently I'm undergoing 3 Front-End development courses via Udemy :smile: <br>
When I'm not learning and developing my Front-End skills, you can find me reading a book or planning my next travel - I love travelling :airplane: Other hobbies include photography, listening to music and learning new languages.
